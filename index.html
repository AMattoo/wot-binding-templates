              Authorized controllers can be located anywhere, as the proxy is globally reachable.

        <p>
          There are a wide variety of physical device configurations for WoT implementations.

          The WoT should provide a bridge between these existing and developing IoT
          solutions and Web technology based on WoT concepts.
          The WoT should be upwards compatible with existing IoT solutions and current standards.

        Security and privacy considerations are still under discussion and development; the content below should be considered preliminary.
        Due to the complexity of the subject
        we are considering producing a separate document containing a detailed security and privacy considerations discussion
        including a risk analysis,
        threat model,
        recommended mitigations,
        and appropriate references to best practices.
        A summary will be included here.
        Work in progress is located in the
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/">WoT Security and Privacy</a> repository.

      <p><!-- Security requirements for the the WoT -->
        Security is a cross-cutting issue that needs to be taken into account in all
        <a href="#sec-building-blocks">WoT building blocks</a>.
        The W3C WoT does not define any new security mechanisms,
        but provides guidelines to apply the best practices from
        Web security,
        IoT security,
        and information security for general software and hardware considerations.

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        An abstract architecture for the Web of Things and a functional architecture for <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> has been introduced.
        It is based on WoT building blocks, which are to be covered by additional WoT specifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a>,</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">WoT Binding Templates</a>, and</li>
        <li>the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">WoT Scripting API</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of these, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing-description-td">WoT Thing Description</a> is the primary building block, as it describes the network-facing interface of a Thing (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-wot-interface">WoT Interface</a>),
        whether or not it uses <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> internally.
        The implementation of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-binding-templates">WoT Binding Templates</a> results in multiple possible Protocol Bindings, so that a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> can communicate with different <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-iot-platform">IoT Platforms</a> (i.e., IoT ecosystems or standards).
        When a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-thing">Thing</a> uses the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-scripting-api">WoT Scripting API</a> internally,
        its application logic can be programmed against a standardized contract using JavaScript.
        This way, it simplifies IoT application development and enables portability across vendors and WoT network components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architecture described here applies well to a wide variety of different use cases.
        Based on these, we have described serveral scenarios where one or more <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-architecture/blob/master/terminology.md#user-content-servient">Servients</a> were used together to overcome,
        for instance, limitations on the reach of specific communication protocols.
        These examples are not exhaustive and are only meant to illustrate the applicability and flexibility of the WoT approach.
